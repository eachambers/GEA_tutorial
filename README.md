# GEA_tutorial

## Package installation and dataset downloads

There are a number of R packages required for this tutorial, and we'll be using two example datasets for our exercises. Refer to the [GEA_preparation file](https://github.com/eachambers/GEA_tutorial/blob/main/GEA_preparation.Rmd) for all installation and download requirements. Take a look at my [lecture slides](https://github.com/eachambers/GEA_tutorial/blob/main/GEA_lecture.pdf) to get some background and an idea what each exercise covers.

## Exercises

We'll be doing two separate exercises (with each of our example datasets):
- [Exercise 1](https://github.com/eachambers/GEA_tutorial/blob/main/Exercises/Exercise1.R) runs RDA on *Sceloporus* lizards; refer to the [algatr RDA vignette](https://thewanglab.github.io/algatr/articles/RDA_vignette.html) for help
- [Exercise 2](https://github.com/eachambers/GEA_tutorial/blob/main/Exercises/Exercise2.R) runs LFMM on *Chrysomela* willow leaf beetles; refer to the [algatr LFMM vignette](https://thewanglab.github.io/algatr/articles/LFMM_vignette.html) for help

## Helpful GEA resources

There are a number of excellent tutorials available online to walk users through running GEA methods:
- The tutorial accompanying [Capblancq & Forester (2021)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13722) available [here](https://github.com/Capblancq/RDA-landscape-genomics/tree/main)
- Tutorial by Brenna Forester available [here](https://popgen.nescent.org/2018-03-27_RDA_GEA.html); also the end of this tutorial provides a bunch of good references
